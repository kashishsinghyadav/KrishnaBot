    "36. What pleasure indeed could be ours, O Jnanardana, from killing these sons of Dhritarashtra? Sin only could take hold of us by the slaying of these felons. [*36]": {},

    "1. To him who was thus overwhelmed with pity and sorrowing, and whose eyes were dimmed with tears, Madhusudana spoke these words: [*1]": {},

    "4. --But how can I, in battle, O slayer of Madhu, fight with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are rather worthy to be worshipped, O destroyer of foes!": {},
    "5. Surely it would be better even to eat the bread of beggary in this life than to slay these great-souled masters. But if I kill them, even in this world, all my enjoyment of wealth and desires will be stained with blood. [*5]": {},

    "7. With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, with a mind in confusion about duty, I supplicate Thee. Say decidedly what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who have taken refuge in Thee. [*7]": {},
    "8. I do not see anything to remove this sorrow which blasts my senses, even were I to obtain unrivalled and flourishing dominion over the earth, and mastery over the gods.": {},
    "9. Having spoken thus to the Lord of the senses, Gudakesha, the scorcher of foes, said to Govinda, \"I shall not fight,\" and became silent. [*9]": {},
    "10. To him who was sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, Hrishikesha, as if smiling, O descendant of Bharata! spoke these words. [*10]": {},
    "11. Thou hast been mourning for them who should not be mourned for. Yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The (truly) wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead. [*11]": {},
    "12. It is not that I have never existed, nor thou, nor these kings. Nor is it that we shall cease to exist in the future. [*12]": {},
    "13. As are childhood, youth, and old age, in this body, to the embodied soul, so": {},
    "14. Notions of heat and cold, of pain and pleasure, are born, O son of Kunti, only of the contact of the senses with their objects. They have a beginning and an end. They are impermanent in their nature. Bear them patiently, O descendant of Bharata. [*14]": {},
    "15. That calm man who is the same in pain and pleasure, whom these cannot disturb, alone is able, O great amongst men, to attain to immortality. [*15]": {},
    "16. The unreal never is. The Real never is not. Men possessed of the knowledge of the Truth fully know both these. [*16]": {},
    "17. That by which all this is pervaded,--That know for certain to be indestructible. None has the power to destroy this Immutable. [*17]": {},
    "18. Of this indwelling Self, the ever-changeless, the indestructible, the illimitable,--these bodies are said to have an end. Fight therefore, O descendant of Bharata. [*18]": {},
    "19. He who takes the Self to be the slayer, he who takes It to be the slain, neither of these knows. It does not slay, nor is It slain. [*19]": {},
    "20. This in never born, nor does It die. It is not that not having been It again comes into being. (Or according to another view: It is not that having been It again ceases to be). This is unborn, eternal, changeless, ever-Itself. It is not killed when the body is killed. [*20]": {},
    "21. He that knows This to be indestructible, changeless, without birth, and immutable, how is he, O son of Pritha, to slay or cause another to slay? [*21]": {},
    "22. Even as a man casts off worn-out clothes, and puts on others which are new, so the embodied casts off worn-out bodies, and enters into others which are new. [*22]": {},
    "23. This (Self), weapons cut not; This, fire burns not; This, water wets not; and This, wind dries not.": {},
    "24. This Self cannot be cut, nor burnt, nor wetted, nor dried. Changeless, all-pervading, unmoving, immovable, the Self is eternal.": {},
    "25. This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou oughtest not to mourn. [*25]": {},
    "26. But if thou shouldst take This to have constant birth and death, even in that case, O mighty-armed, thou oughtest not to mourn for This. [*26]": {},
    "27. Of that which is born, death is certain, of that which is dead, birth is certain. Over the unavoidable, therefore, thou oughtest not to grieve. [*27]": {},
    "28. All beings are unmanifested in their beginning, O Bharata, manifested in their middle state and unmanifested again in their end. What is there then to grieve about? [*28]": {},
    "29. Some look upon the Self as marvellous. Others speak of It as wonderful. Others again hear of It as a wonder. And still others, though hearing, do not understand It at all. [*29]": {},
    "30. This, the Indweller in the bodies of all, is ever indestructible, O descendant of Bharata. Wherefore thou oughtest not to mourn for any creature. [*30]": {},
    "31. Looking at thine own Dharma, also, thou oughtest not to waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war. [*31]": {},
    "32. Fortunate certainly are the Kshatriyas, O son of Pritha, who are called to fight in such a battle, that comes unsought as an open gate to heaven. [*32]": {},
    "33. But if thou refusest to engage in this righteous warfare, then, forfeiting thine own Dharma and honour, thou shalt incur sin.": {},
    "34. The world also will ever hold thee in reprobation. To the honoured, disrepute is surely worse than death. [*34]": {},
    "35. The great chariot-warriors [**] will believe that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear. And thou wilt be lightly esteemed by them who have thought much of thee.": {},
    "36. Thine enemies also, cavilling at thy great prowess, will say of thee things that are not to be uttered. What could be more intolerable than this?": {},
    "37. Dying thou gainest heaven; conquering thou enjoyest the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, arise, resolved to fight.": {},
    "38. Having made pain and pleasure, gain and loss, conquest and defeat, the same, engage thou then in battle. So shalt thou incur no sin. [*38]": {},
    "39. The wisdom of Self-realisation has been declared unto thee. Hearken thou now to the wisdom of Yoga, endued with which, O son of Pritha, thou shalt break through the bonds of Karma. [*39]": {},
    "40. In this, there is no waste of the unfinished attempt, nor is there production of contrary results. Even very little of this Dharma protects from the great terror. [*52]": {},
    "41. In this, O scion of Kuru, there is but a single one-pointed determination. The purposes of the undecided are innumerable and many-branching. [*53]": {},
    "45. The Vedas deal with the three Gunas. Be thou free, O Arjuna, from the triad of the Gunas, free from the pairs of opposites, ever-balanced, free from (the thought of) getting and keeping, and established in the Self. [*45]": {},
    "46. To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of so much use as a reservoir is, when there is a flood everywhere. [*46]": {},
    "47. Thy right is to work only; but never to the fruits thereof. Be thou not the producer of the fruits of (thy) actions; neither let thy attachment be towards inaction. [*47]": {},
    "48. Being steadfast in Yoga, Dhananjaya, perform actions, abandoning attachment, remaining unconcerned as regards success and failure. This evenness. of mind (in regard to success and failure) is known as Yoga.": {},
    "49. Work (with desire) is verily far inferior to that performed with the mind undisturbed by thoughts of results. O": {},
    "50. Endued with this evenness of mind, one frees oneself in this life, alike from vice and virtue. Devote thyself, therefore, to this Yoga. Yoga is the very dexterity of work. [*50]": {},
    "51. The wise, possessed of this evenness of mind, abandoning the fruits of their actions, freed for ever from the fetters of birth, go to that state which is beyond all evil.": {},
    "52. When thy intellect crosses beyond the taint of illusion, then shalt thou attain to indifference, regarding things heard and things yet to be heard. [*52]": {},
    "53. When thy intellect, tossed about by the conflict of opinions--has become immovable and firmly established in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.": {},
    "54. What, O Keshava, is the description of the man of steady wisdom, merged in Samadhi? How (on the other hand) does the man of steady wisdom speak, how sit, how walk? [*54]": {},
    "55. When a man completely casts away, O Partha, all the desires of the mind, satisfied in the Self alone by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom. [*55]": {},
    "56. He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after happiness, who has become free from affection, fear, and wrath, is indeed the Muni of steady wisdom. [*63]": {},
    "57. He who is everywhere unattached, not pleased at receiving good, nor vexed at evil, his wisdom is fixed. [*57]": {},
    "58. When also, like the tortoise its limbs, he can completely withdraw the senses from their objects, then his wisdom becomes steady. [*58]": {},
    "59. Objects fall away from the abstinent man, leaving the longing behind. But his longing also ceases, who sees the Supreme. [*59]": {},
    "60. The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, do violently snatch away the mind of even a wise man, striving after perfection.": {},
    "61. The steadfast, having controlled them all, sits focussed on Me as the Supreme. His wisdom is steady, whose senses are under control.": {},
    "62. Thinking of objects, attachment to them is formed in a man. From attachment longing, and from longing anger grows.": {},
    "63. From anger comes delusion, and from delusion loss of memory. From loss of memory comes the ruin of discrimination, and from the ruin of discrimination he perishes. [*63]": {},
    "64. But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with senses under restraint, and free from attraction and aversion, attains to tranquillity. [*64]": {},
    "65. In tranquillity, all sorrow is destroyed. For the intellect of him who is tranquil-minded, is soon established in firmness. [*65]": {},
    "66. No knowledge (of the Self) has the unsteady. Nor has he meditation. To the unmeditative there is no peace. And how can one without peace have happiness?": {},
    "67. For, the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as a wind (carries away from its course) a boat on the waters.": {},
    "68. Therefore, O mighty-armed, his knowledge is steady, whose senses are completely restrained from their objects. [*68]": {},
    "69. That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man wakes. That in which all beings wake, is night to the Self-seeing Muni. [*69]": {},
    "70. As into the ocean,--brimful, and still,--flow the waters, even so the Muni into whom enter all desires, he, and not the desirer of desires, attains to peace. [*70]": {},
    "71. That man who lives devoid of longing, abandoning all desires, without the sense of 'I' and 'mine,' he attains to peace. [*71]": {},
    "72. This is to have one's being in Brahman, O son of Pritha. None, attaining to this, becomes deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, a man attains to oneness with Brahman.": {},
    "1. If, O Janardana, according to Thee, knowledge is superior to action, why then, O Keshava, dost Thou engage me in this terrible action?": {},
    "2. With these seemingly conflicting words, Thou art, as it were, bewildering my understanding;--tell me that one thing for certain, by which I can attain to the highest.": {},
    "3. In the beginning (of creation), O sinless one, the twofold path of devotion was given by Me to this world;--the path of knowledge for the meditative, the path of work for the active. [*3]": {},
    "4. By non-performance of work none reaches worklessness; by merely giving up action no one attains to perfection. [*4]": {},
    "5. Verily none can ever rest for even an instant, without performing action; for all are made to act, helplessly indeed, by the Gunas, born of Prakriti. [*5]": {},
    "6. He, who restraining the organs of action, sits revolving in the mind, thoughts regarding objects of senses, he, of deluded understanding, is called a hypocrite.": {},
    "7. But, who, controlling the senses by the mind, unattached, directs his organs of action to the path of work, he, O Arjuna, excels.": {},
    "8. Do thou perform obligatory [**] action; for action is superior to inaction, and even the bare maintenance of thy body would not be possible if thou art inactive.": {},
    "9. The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of Yajna; do thou therefore, O son of Kunti, perform action for Yajna alone, devoid of attachment. [*9]": {},
    "10. The Prajapati, having in the beginning created mankind together with Yajna, said,--\"By this shall ye multiply: this shall be the milch cow of your desires. [*10]": {},
    "11. \"Cherish the Devas with this, and may those Devas cherish you: thus cherishing one another, ye shall gain the highest good. [*11]": {},
    "12. \"The Devas, cherished by Yajna, will give you desired-for objects.\" So, he who enjoys objects given by the Devas without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.": {},
    "13. The good, eating the remnants of Yajna, are freed from all sins: but who cook food (only) for themselves, those sinful ones eat sin. [*13]": {},
    "14. From food come forth beings: from rain food is produced: from Yajna arises rain and Yajna is born of Karma. [*14]": {},
    "15. Know Karma to have risen from the Veda, and the Veda from the Imperishable. Therefore the all-pervading Veda is ever centred in Yajna. [*15]": {},
    "16. He, who here follows not the wheel thus set revolving, living in sin, and satisfied in the senses, O son of Pritha,--he lives in vain. [*16]": {},
    "17. But the man who is devoted to the Self, and is satisfied with the Self, and content in the Self alone, he has no obligatory duty.": {},
    "18. He has no object in this world (to gain) by doing (an action), nor (does he incur any loss) by non-performance of action,--nor has he (need of) depending on any being for any object.": {},
    "19. Therefore, do thou always perform actions which are obligatory, without attachment;--by performing action without attachment, one attains to the highest.": {},
    "20. Verily by action alone, Janaka and others attained perfection;--also, simply with the view for the guidance of men, thou shouldst perform action. [*20]": {},
    "21. Whatsoever the superior person does, that is followed by others. What he demonstrates by action, that, people follow.": {},
    "22. I have, O son of Pritha, no duty, nothing that I have not gained, and nothing that I have to gain, in the three worlds; yet, I continue in action.": {},
    "23. If ever I did not continue in work, without relaxation, men, O son of Pritha, would in every way, follow in My wake.": {},
    "24. If I did not do work, these worlds would perish. I should be the cause of the admixture of races, and I should ruin these beings.": {},
    "25. As do the unwise, attached to work, act, so should the wise act, O descendant of Bharata, (but) without": {},
    "26. One should not unsettle the understanding of the ignorant, attached to action; the wise, (himself) steadily acting, should engage (the ignorant) in all work.": {},
    "27. The Gunas of Prakriti perform all action. With the understanding deluded by egoism, man thinks, \"I am the doer.\"": {},
    "28. But, one, with true insight into the domains of Guna and Karma, knowing that Gunas as senses merely rest on Gunas as objects, does not become attached. [*28]": {},
    "29. Men of perfect knowledge should not unsettle (the understanding of) people of dull wit and imperfect knowledge, who deluded by the Gunas of Prakriti attach (themselves) to the functions of the Gunas. [*29]": {},
    "30. Renouncing all actions to Me, with mind centred on the Self, getting rid of hope and selfishness, fight,--free from (mental) fever.": {},
    "31. Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine, full of Shraddha and without cavilling, they too, are freed from work. [*31]": {},
    "32. But those who decrying this teaching of Mine do not practise (it), deluded in all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be ruined.": {},
    "33. Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature: beings follow nature: what can restraint do? [*33]": {},
    "34. Attachment and aversion of the senses for their respective objects are natural: let none come under their sway: they are his foes. [*34]": {},
    "35. Better is one's own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of another well-performed. Better is death in one's own Dharma: the Dharma of another is fraught with fear. [*35]": {},
    "36. But by what impelled does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya, constrained as it were, by force? [*36]": {},
    "37. It is desire--it is anger, born of the Rajo-guna: of great craving, and of great sin; know this as the foe here (in this world). [*37]": {},
    "38. As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo by the secundine, so is it covered by that. [*38]": {},
    "39. Knowledge is covered by this, the constant foe of the wise, O son of Kunti, the unappeasable fire of desire. [*39]": {},
    "40. The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its abode: through these, it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. [*40]": {},
    "41. Therefore, O Bull of the Bharata race, controlling the senses at the outset, kill it,--the sinful, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.": {},
    "42. The senses are said to be superior (to the body); the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and that which is superior to the intellect is He (the Atman).": {},
    "43. Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect, and restraining": {},
    "1. I told this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat told it to Manu; (and) Manu told it to Ikshvaku: [*1]": {},
    "2. Thus handed down in regular succession, the royal sages knew it. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, declined in this world, O burner of foes.": {},
    "3. I have this day told thee that same ancient Yoga, (for) thou art My devotee, and My friend, and this secret is profound indeed. [*3]": {},
    "4. Later was Thy birth, and that of Vivasvat prior; how then should I understand that Thou toldest this in the beginning?": {},
    "5. Many are the births that have been passed by Me and thee, O Arjuna. I know them all, whilst thou knowest not, O scorcher of foes.": {},
    "6. Though I am unborn, of changeless nature and Lord of beings, yet subjugating My Prakriti, I come into being by My own Maya. [*6]": {},
    "7. Whenever, O descendant of Bharata, there is decline of Dharma, and rise of Adharma, then I body Myself forth. [*7]": {},
    "8. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of Dharma, I come into being in every age. [*8]": {},
    "9. He who thus knows, in true light, My divine birth and action, leaving the body, is not born again: he attains to Me, O Arjuna. [*9]": {},
    "10. Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of Knowledge, many have attained My Being. [*10]": {},
    "11. In whatever way men worship Me, in the same way do I fulfil their desires: (it is) My path, O son of Pritha, (that) men tread, in all ways. [*11]": {},
    "12. Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the gods. Because success, resulting from action, is, quickly attained in the human world. [*12]": {},
    "13. The fourfold caste was created by Me, by the differentiation of Guna and Karma. Though I am the author thereof, know Me to be the non-doer, and changeless. [*13]": {},
    "14. Actions do not taint Me, nor have I any thirst for the result of action. He who knows Me thus is not fettered by action. [*14]": {},
    "15. Knowing thus, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action. Do thou, therefore, perform action, as did the ancients in olden times. [*15]": {},
    "16. Even sages are bewildered, as to what is action and what is inaction. I shall therefore tell you what action is, by knowing which you will be freed from evil. [*16]": {},
    "17. For verily, (the true nature) even of action (enjoined by the Shastras) should": {},
    "18. He who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is intelligent among men, he is a Yogi and a doer of all action. [*18]": {},
    "19. Whose undertakings are all devoid of plan and desire for results, and whose actions are burnt by the fire of knowledge, him, the sages call wise. [*19]": {},
    "20. Forsaking the clinging to fruits of action, ever satisfied, depending on nothing, though engaged in action, he does not do anything.": {},
    "21. Without hope, the body and mind controlled and all possessions relinquished, he does not suffer any evil consequences, by doing mere bodily action. [*21]": {},

Yet some offer as sacrifice, the outgoing into the in-coming breath, and the in-coming into the out-going, stopping the courses of the in-coming and out-going breaths, constantly practising the regulation of the vital energy; while others yet of regulated food, offer in the Pranas the functions thereof.

    "46. The Yogi is regarded as superior to those who practise asceticism, also to those who have obtained wisdom (through the Shastras). He is also superior to the performers of action, (enjoined in the Vedas). Therefore, be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna! [*46]": {},

    "3. One, perchance, in thousands of men, strives for perfection; and one perchance, among the blessed ones, striving thus, knows Me in reality. [*3]": {},
    "4. Bhumi (earth), Ap (water), Anala (fire), Vayu (air), Kha (ether), mind, intellect, and egoism: thus is My Prakriti divided eight-fold. [*4]": {},

    "10. Know Me, O son of Pritha, as the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, and the heroism of the heroic.": {},
    "11. Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment. I am, O bull among the Bharatas, desire in beings, unopposed to Dharma. [*11]": {},
    "12. And whatever states pertaining to Sattva, and those pertaining to Rajas, and to Tamas, know them to proceed from Me alone; still I am not in them, but they are in Me. [*12]": {},

    "14. Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, constituted of the Gunas, is difficult to cross over; those who devote themselves to Me alone, cross over this illusion. [*14]": {},
    "15. They do not devote themselves to Me,--the evil-doers, the deluded, the lowest of men, deprived of discrimination by Maya, and following the way of the Asuras. [*15]": {},
    "16. Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna,--the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of enjoyment, and the wise, O bull among the Bharatas. [*16]": {},

    "18. Noble indeed are they all, but the wise man I regard as My very Self; for with the mind steadfast, he is established in Me alone, as the supreme goal.": {},
    "19. At the end of many births, the man of wisdom takes refuge in Me, realising that all this is Vasudeva (the innermost Self). Very rare is that great soul.": {},
    "20. Others again, deprived of discrimination by this or that desire, following this or that rite, devote themselves to other gods, led by their own natures. [*20]": {},
    "21. Whatsoever form any devotee seeks to worship with Shraddha,--that Shraddha of his do I make unwavering.": {},
    "22. Endued with that Shraddha, he engages in the worship of that, and from it, gains his desires,--these being verily dispensed by Me alone.": {},
    "23. But the fruit (accruing) to these men of little understanding is limited. The worshippers of the Devas go to the Devas; My devotees too come to me. [*23]": {},
    "24. The foolish regard Me, the un-manifested, as come into manifestation, not knowing My supreme state,--immutable and transcendental. [*24]": {},
    "25. Veiled by the illusion born of the congress of the Gunas, I am not manifest to all. This deluded world knows Me not, the Unborn, the Immutable. [*25]": {},
    "26. I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the whole past, and the present, and the future, but Me none knoweth.": {},
    "27. By the delusion of the pairs of opposites, arising from desire and aversion, O descendant of Bharata, all beings fall into delusion at birth, O scorcher of foes. [*27]": {},
    "28. Those men of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end,--they, freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me with firm resolve.": {},
    "29. Those who strive for freedom from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, they know. Brahman, the whole of Adhyatma, and Karma in its entirety. [*29]": {},
    "30. Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta, the Adhidaiva, and the Adhiyajna, (continue to) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind. [*30]": {},
    "1. What is that Brahman, what is Adhyatma, what is Karma, O best of Purushas? What is called Adhibhuta, and what Adhidaiva?": {},
    "2. Who, and in what way, is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu? And how art Thou known at the time of death, by the self-controlled?": {},
    "3. The Imperishable is the Supreme Brahman. Its dwelling in each individual body is called Adhyatma; the offering in sacrifice which causes the genesis and support of beings, is called Karma. [*3]": {},
    "4. The perishable adjunct is the Adhibhuta, and the Indweller is the Adhidaivata; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best of the embodied. [*4]": {},
    "5. And he, who at the time of death, meditating on Me alone, goes forth, leaving the body, attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.": {},
    "6. Remembering whatever object, at the end, he leaves the body, that alone is reached by him, O son of Kunti, (because) of his constant thought of that object. [*6]": {},
    "7. Therefore, at all times, constantly remember Me, and fight. With mind and intellect absorbed, in Me, thou shalt doubtless come to Me. [*7]": {},
    "8. With the mind not moving towards anything else, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and dwelling on the Supreme, Resplendent Purusha, O son of Pritha, one goes to Him. [*8]": {},

    "14. I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogin who remembers Me constantly and daily, with a single mind, O son of Pritha.": {},
    "15. Reaching the highest perfection, and having attained Me, the great-souled ones are no more subject to re-birth--which is the home of pain, and ephemeral. [*15]": {},
    "16. All the worlds, O Arjuna, including the realm of Brahma, are subject to return, but after attaining Me, O son of Kunti, there is no re-birth. [*16]": {},
    "17. They who know (the true measure of) day and night, know the day of Brahma, which ends in a thousand Yugas, and the night which (also) ends in a thousand Yugas. [*17]": {},
    "18. At the approach of (Brahma's) day, all manifestations proceed from the unmanifested state; at the approach of night, they merge verily into that alone, which is called the unmanifested.": {},
    "19. The very same multitude of beings (that existed in the preceding day of Brahma), being born again and again, merge, in spite of themselves, O son of Pritha, (into the unmanifested), at the approach of night, and re-manifest at the approach of day. [*19]": {},

    "22. And that Supreme Purusha is attainable, O son of Pritha, by whole-souled devotion to Him alone, in Whom all beings dwell, and by Whom all this is pervaded.": {},
    "23. Now I shall tell thee, O bull of the Bharatas, of the time (path) travelling in which, the Yogis return, (and again of that, taking which) they do not return.": {},
    "24. Fire, flame, day-time, the bright fortnight, the six months of the Northern passage of the sun, taking this path, the knowers of Brahman go to Brahman.": {},
    "25. Smoke, night-time, the dark fortnight, the six months of the Southern passage of the sun--taking this path the Yogi, attaining the lunar light, returns. [*25]": {},
    "26. Truly are these bright and dark paths of the world considered eternal: one leads to non-return; by the other, one returns. [*26]": {},
    "27. No Yogi, O son of Pritha, is deluded after knowing these paths. Therefore, O Arjuna, be thou steadfast in Yoga, at all times. [*27]": {},
    "28. Whatever meritorious effect is declared (in the Scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) Yajnas, (the practice of) austerities and gifts,--above all this rises the Yogi, having known this, and attains to the primeval, supreme Abode. [*28]": {},
    "1. To thee, who dost not carp, verily shall I now declare this, the most profound knowledge, united with realisation, having known which, thou shalt be free from evil (Samsara).": {},
    "2. Of sciences, the highest; of profundities, the deepest; of purifiers, the supreme, is this; realisable by direct perception, endowed with (immense) merit, very easy to perform, and of an imperishable nature.": {},
    "3. Persons without Shraddha for this Dharma, return, O scorcher of foes, without attaining Me, to the path of re-birth fraught with death. [*3]": {},
    "4. All this world is pervaded by me in My unmanifested form: all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them. [*4]": {},
    "5. Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality), behold My Divine Yoga! Bringing forth and supporting the beings, My Self does not dwell in them. [*5]": {},
    "6. As the mighty wind, moving always everywhere, rests ever in the Akasha, know thou, that even so do all beings rest in Me. [*6]": {},
    "7. At the end of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti, all beings go back to My Prakriti: at the beginning of (another) Kalpa, I send them forth again. [*7]": {},
    "8. Animating My Prakriti, I project again and again this whole multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakriti. [*8]": {},
    "9. These acts do not bind Me, sitting as one neutral, unattached to them, O Dhananjaya. [*9]": {},
    "10. By reason of My proximity, Prakriti produces all this, the moving and the unmoving; the world wheels round and round, O son of Kunti, because of this. [*10]": {},
    "11. Unaware of My higher state, as the great Lord of beings, fools disregard Me, dwelling in the human form. [*11]": {},
    "12. Of vain hopes, of vain works, of vain knowledge, and senseless, they verily are possessed of the delusive nature of Rakshasas and Asuras. [*12]": {},

    "19. (As sun) I give heat: I withhold and send forth rain; I am immortality and also death; being and non-being am I, O Arjuna! [*19]": {},
    "20. The knowers of the three Vedas, worshipping Me by Yajna, drinking the Soma, and (thus) being purified from sin, pray for passage to heaven; reaching the holy world of the Lord of the Devas, they enjoy in heaven the divine pleasures of the Devas. [*20]": {},
    "21. Having enjoyed the vast Swarga-world, they enter the mortal world, on the exhaustion of their merit: Thus, abiding by the injunctions of the three (Vedas), desiring desires, they (constantly) come and go. [*21]": {},

    "23. Even those devotees, who endued with Shraddha, worship other gods, they too worship Me alone, O son of Kunti, (but) by the wrong method. [*23]": {},
    "24. For I alone am the Enjoyer, and Lord of all Yajnas; but because they do not know Me in reality, they return, (to the mortal world). [*24]": {},
    "25. Votaries of the Devas go to the Devas; to the Pitris, go their votaries; to the Bhutas, go the Bhuta worshippers; My votaries too come unto Me. [*25]": {},

    "10. Sattva arises, O descendant of Bharata, predominating over Rajas and 'Tamas; and Rajas over Sattva and Tamas; so, Tamas over Sattva and Rajas. [*10]": {},
    "11. When through every sense in this body, the light of intelligence shines, then it should be known that Sattva is predominant. [*11]": {},
    "12. Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, unrest, longing--these arise when Rajas is predominant, O bull of the: Bharatas. [*12]": {},
    "13. Darkness, inertness, miscomprehension, and delusion,--these arise when Tamas is predominant, O descendant of Kuru. [*13]": {},
    "14. If the embodied one meets death when Sattva is predominant, then he attains to the spotless regions of the worshippers of the Highest. [*14]": {},
    "15. Meeting death in Rajas he is born among those attached to action; so dying in Tamas, he is born in the wombs of the irrational. [*15]": {},

    "17. From Sattva arises wisdom, and greed from Rajas; miscomprehension, delusion and ignorance arise from Tamas.": {},
    "18. The Sattva-abiding go upwards; the Rajasika dwell in the middle; and the Tamasika, abiding in the function. of the lowest Guna, go downwards.": {},
